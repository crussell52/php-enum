php-enum
=======

This project is an Enumeration implementation for PHP >= 5.5 which is based on the concepts behind the Java Enum data type.

Normally, I don't try to force one language's constructs into a different language. However, in my time with Java I have grown to appreciate their Enum data type. I believe the functionality offered is significant enough to warrant a php implementation.

Check out the full [Project Description](https://github.com/crussell52/php-enum/wiki/Description) and [Features](https://github.com/crussell52/php-enum/wiki/Features) on the Wiki!


I've also included an example file which will demostrate the primary features of php-enum. (Just make sure you modify the path to the trait at the top of the file!)
